<!-- <h2 class="landscape-title">Thesis Book</h2> -->
<!-- <p class="landscape-description">I was invited to design the logo & identity for Saima Park String Circle, a new local music ensemble that was formed during the pandemic, when orchestras had to shut down. The ensemble plays outdoors, and musicians stand in a large circle, spaced ten feet apart. Here's some of my process work and sketches:</p> -->

<!-- <p class="landscape-description">Here are some of my initial logo concepts. Some represent the strings on the instruments, others the circle the musicians stand in, and others the friendly, welcoming nature of the ensemble. I presented the logos to the ensemble director and musicians, and they liked on the one with dots forming the circle.</p> -->

<!-- <p class="landscape-description">Next, I refined the logo, and fine-tuned spacing, size, color, and font choice. For the font, I looked for one that was friendly and welcoming but still professional&mdash;and ultimately chose Europa typeface.</p> -->

<h2 class="landscape-title">Visualizing Scriabin's Sonata no. 2</h2>
<p class="landscape-description">My MFA graphic design thesis involves visualizing Sonata no. 2, a piano piece by the pianist 
    and composer Alexander Scriabin. Scriabin was interested in color,
     and he believed that combining music with other stimuli would enhance the audience’s experience of the music. <br><br>
    Inspired by the idea of a multi-sensory experience, I created an image for each phrase or short musical idea in the music. 
    I created the images by combining photography, painting, and text. I wrote about the music, and combined the text and images into a book.
     I designed the structure and pacing of the book to reflect that of the music. <br><br> Music and design both involve layers, transparency, texture, rhythm, and expression. 
     My goal is to visually communicate the different rhythms, harmonies, melodies, moods, and characters of each phrase through color, composition, and type. 
     <br><br>The images in this book offer one interpretation of Scriabin’s Sonata no. 2.
