Hi Don,

Just letting you know I submitted my first application to MassArt. It 
asked for the professors' school emails, so I sent it to your school 
email. It also asked for phone numbers, so I put in your office number. 
Thank you for your suggestions for my essay! I also included the 
printmaking photos. Oh, also, on the application I had to specify either 
painting or printmaking so I'm not sure it's a combined program (I 
selected painting).

Many many thanks :)

Cindy
