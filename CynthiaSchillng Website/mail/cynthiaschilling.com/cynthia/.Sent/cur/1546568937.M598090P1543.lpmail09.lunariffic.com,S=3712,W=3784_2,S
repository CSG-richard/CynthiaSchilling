I have to edit it a little more, but it's almost done

Dear members of the graduate admissions committee,

I am excited about the prospect of pursuing an MFA in 2D Fine Arts: 
painting at Massachusetts College of Art and Design. I am passionate 
about art and design. After earning a degree in piano performance with 
greatest distinction from UMass Amherst Commonwealth Honors College, I 
began pursuing a second degree as an interdisciplinary major in studio 
art and graphic design at Fitchburg State University. I have been 
exploring ways that art and music can interact — how tone, dynamics, 
harmony, and emotion in music can be depicted through form, lines, and 
color. For my senior capstone project, I am researching piano 
compositions writing about their history and music theory. For each 
composition, I am creating an abstract painting that is related in form, 
structure and expression. In a book, I will combine the text and images.

I have taken a range of studio art and graphic design courses and am 
particularly interested in painting. In my portfolio, I included some 
examples of my graphic design work; certain skills (such as composition 
and color) that I’ve developed in my design courses transfer to my 
painting. Having explored many dimensions of art and design, I look 
forward to graduate school, where I can focus in on a specific area of 
art and find my voice as an artist.

I love the process of learning a new skill and creating a new work of 
art. In my creative practice as a musician, I especially enjoy 
experimenting — trying different touches on the piano keys, playing with 
timing — and observing how these variables alter tone and expression. 
Similarly, in my art and design work, I enjoy experimenting with color, 
type, medium, style, layout, etc. to create original and innovative 
pieces.

The quality of mind I developed from creative and in-depth thinking 
about music applies to the conceptual aspects of art. Both music and art 
require creativity, sensitivity to detail, and emotional expression. 
 This same kind of discipline, incorporation of feedback, and continuous 
reworking that is part of the process of learning and performing music 
is also part of the art and design process, and it has helped me to push 
my creative boundaries in my artwork.

At Fitchburg State, I have had various opportunities to apply my art and 
design skills. As the website development assistant at the university, I 
provide technical support to faculty and staff and redesign pages to 
make them more user-friendly and visually appealing. I have designed 
posters, programs, and promotional materials for the Fitchburg State 
orchestra, choirs, community music lesson program, and the annual Women 
in the Arts events. In addition, I have worked as a piano instructor in 
the lesson program, and as a tutor for writing, music, and web design 
courses.

In continuing to develop my art and design skills to reach higher levels 
of artistry, I would love the opportunity to take classes and interact 
with other motivated and talented graduate students and faculty. I am 
excited MassArt’s _____ *will write about why I want to go to MassArt*  
I would be thrilled to continue my studies at MassArt.

Thank you for your consideration.

Sincerely,
Cynthia Schilling
