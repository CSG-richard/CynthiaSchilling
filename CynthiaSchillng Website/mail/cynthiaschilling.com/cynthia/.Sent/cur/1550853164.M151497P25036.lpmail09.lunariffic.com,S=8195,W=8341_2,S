Hi Don,

Here's what I've written so far (I'll clean up grammar mistakes and 
citation format and such later). I'm still deciding on the best way to 
organize the text in the book. I'll continue to write, but I thought I'd 
send you what I have so far. Thanks!

General Process/about
I think it’s fascinating how both music and art can be completely 
non-representational, but can still evoke such strong emotions. My 
paintings are visualizations of the expressive and emotional qualities 
of musical compositions. They translate one sense to another: sound to 
sight. Kandinsky wrote “With few exceptions music has been for some 
centuries the art which has devoted itself not to the preproduction of 
natural phenomena, but rather to the expression of the artist’s soul, in 
musical sound.” (p. 19 in Concerning the Spiritual in Art). While 
painting, I had to find a balance between deliberate and spontaneous — 
so not making marks so deliberate that the painting looks too 
calculated, but not so spontaneous that it looks like a mess of random 
paint splotches. I picked some of my favorite pieces of music. I’ve 
played most of the pieces I picked and spent hundreds of hours 
practicing them, so I knew them well and had already put extensive 
thought into the characters of each piece.

At first, it was very overwhelming to decide how to paint the music. The 
emotions that music and art evoke are subjective. Additionally, 
different musicians interpret and play pieces differently, taking 
liberties in tempo (subtly slowing down or speeding up), dynamics 
(playing loudly or softly), touch (e.g. a sharp, attack sound vs. round, 
warm sound), articulations (e.g. legato vs staccato), all of which 
creates different (sometimes wildly different) characters and moods. So 
the same piece (or parts of the piece) could sound like one character or 
mood when played by one musician, and a completely different emotion by 
another. All of the pieces I chose are complex and have many different 
moods and characters within each piece, so I chose the dominant 
emotion(s) of each piece to portray in their corresponding paintings.

There’s an infinite number of ways to portray the music, and I didn’t 
have any rules or limitations, which was overwhelming. The composer Igor 
Stravinsky stated “Whatever diminishes constraint, diminishes strength. 
The more constraints one imposes, the more one frees one’s self of the 
chains that shackle the spirit.” (p. 65 of Poetics of Music in the Form 
of Six Lessons, by Stravinsky). I had to create some some rules for each 
painting, such as a palette of  certain colors or painting no sharp 
angles. My approach to each painting was to listen to the piece and form 
a vague mental image of possible colors, form, composition for the 
painting, based on the piece’s characters, elements, and overall 
structure. I then started painting using that mental image as a guide, 
but usually changing my plan along the way. Sometimes I’d accidentally 
make a mark on the canvas, but then use the mistake to go in a new 
direction. Sometimes I’d stop in the middle and realize the painting was 
looking like another piece of music, so I’d switch the piece and 
continue. Other times, I didn’t like how it was turning out and 
everything I’d do would keep making it worse, so I’d paint over the 
whole thing with a solid color and start over.

Color is an important part of expression my paintings. Kandinsky 
wrote”…the sound of colours is so definite that it would be hard to find 
anyone who would try to express bright yellow in the bass notes, or dark 
lake in the treble.” (P.25 of Concerning the Spiritual in Art). I 
generally used saturated or bright colors, and rarely any shades of 
gray. Kandinsky writes “…in gray, there is no possibility of movement, 
because gray consists of two colours that have no active force…” (p.37 
of Concerning the Spiritual in Art). In terms of form, most of the marks 
in my painting are curved or irregular shapes, which to me is all much 
more expressive and beautiful than straight lines, perfect geometric 
shapes, and sharp angles that computers can make.

The sense of emotions in pieces and art go two ways: when I am learning 
piano pieces, sometimes I instinctively sense a certain character for a 
particular passage and play accordingly; other times, I don’t have a 
clear idea of its character, and have to come up with one to apply. A 
musician can play a piece with amazing technical abilities, but without 
some kind of expression or feeling, the playing sounds boring, like 
computer playing the piece. In my paintings, I wanted to portray the 
same organic, expressive qualities that are present in human musicians’ 
playing. I embraced any kind of “imperfections.” In music, even the 
greatest musicians make mistakes and play a few wrong notes out of the 
thousands and thousands of notes they play in a concert. Some people 
frown upon mistakes — and severe mistakes are not ideal — but I actually 
think a few minor mistakes can enhance the performance. For example, in 
a piano passage of large chords that jump from one side of the piano to 
the other at a fast tempo, the pianist might accidentally hit two notes 
with the thumb at once. That’d be a minor mistake, but in a way, it 
would convey the extreme technical demands and amplify the excitement. 
So in my paintings, I welcomed many of the unintentional marks I made 
and didn’t paint over them with what I originally intended.

Pieces/paintings descriptions:

Tchaikovsky Dumka (Russian Rustic Scene) 
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rh4aImEYpt8

This piece consists of a melancholy beginning and end, and in-between 
are virtuosic, lively variations on a folk-like melody. It has a bright, 
happy, mood. I chose to paint areas of bright colors and curved lines 
that create a lively cheerful composition. The areas are not completely 
solid but have variations of the main color which adds more dimension.

Ravel Scarbo from Gaspard de la Nuit 
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RTaqhc4HUUA

This piece is mysterious, dark, and scary, which I portrayed with fields 
of dark blues and purples. I showed the sparkling runs of fast notes 
through speckled trails of bright light colors that stand out against 
duller darker areas. The shown deep brooding flutter of notes shown 
through dark speckles. A range of technical demands for the pianist — 
fast repeated notes, large chords, sudden soft to loud, extremely fast 
notes, much of which happens simultaneously— so all of this I captured 
through layers of paint.

Rachmaninoff Rhapsody theme of Paganini 
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yxiiWDxo1JQ

This piece sounds colorful. Virtuosic The famous 18th variation has 
feelings of passion and warmth. I chose swirling areas of paint.

Schumann Aufschwung (Soaring) 
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UodEEci_w5E

The piece has a dense texture with tense loud dissonant chords 
interspersed with a sweet singing melody. The abrupt changes in tempo, 
dynamics, and mood create a feeling of chaos.. I showed this through 
combination of smudged blurry forms with crisper forms and lines.

Schumann sonata g minor https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=z28wyqvvCN8
Schumann wrote at the beginning of the piece “So rasch wie möglich,” 
which means “play as quickly as possible,” and then later on 
“Schneller,” and “Noch Schneller,” which means “play faster than that.” 
Of course, that’s impossible, but it indicates that Schumann intends for 
it to be played with intense frenetic energy. The syncopations and 
constantly-changing moods amplify this energy.

Grieg ballade https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tfjMfPy0Qtc
will work on this painting soon .
