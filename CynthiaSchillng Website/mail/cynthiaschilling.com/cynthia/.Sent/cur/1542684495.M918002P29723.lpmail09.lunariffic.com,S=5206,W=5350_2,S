Okay, how about this version? Thanks for reading these edits.

My IDIS capstone project will combine my two areas of study: graphic 
design and studio art. The topic will be based on 10-12 pieces of 
classical music. I am interested in the combination of music and art; I 
completed a degree in piano performance at UMass Amherst before I came 
to FSU to study art and graphic design, so I am excited about the 
opportunity to incorporate my past studies in music into my current 
studies in art.

Writing & research component: I will research and write about the 
history of each piece and composer, and I will analyze each piece from a 
music theory perspective.

Studio art component: I will explore ways to visually portray the 
musical elements (form, structure, style, dynamics, etc.) of each piece. 
I will create 10-12 paintings and drawings (one for each piece of 
music).

Graphic design component: I will combine my text and images into a book, 
focusing on the micro typography within the book.

Timeline: Each week, I will research and write about 1-2 pieces of 
music, and create 1-2 pieces of art. For the book, I will spend the 
first 3-4 weeks developing and revising the page layout prototypes. 
During the next 12 weeks, I will create the actual spreads, focusing on 
micro typography. I will obtain a proof of the book by mid-March, and I 
will complete the final design by the last week of the semester.

Thank you,
Cindy
