Hi Mukund,

Yes, I'd be happy to! I instructed a paint night event at MIT a couple 
months ago, and it was a lot of fun! You can see some of my paintings on 
my website if you'd like: http://www.cynthiaschilling.com/about.html. 
I'm finishing a degree in studio art and graphic design, and will start 
graduate school in the fall (will decide on which school in a few weeks, 
after I hear from all the ones I applied to).

Do you know which day/time the event will be held? Thursday, Friday, and 
Saturday evenings would be easiest for me, but I might be able to make 
it other days as well.

I look forward to hearing from you!

Best,
Cynthia
