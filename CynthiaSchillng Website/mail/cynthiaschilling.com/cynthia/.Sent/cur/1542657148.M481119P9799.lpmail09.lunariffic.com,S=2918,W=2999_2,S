Okay thanks, how is this?

My IDIS capstone project will combine my two areas of study: graphic 
design and studio art. The topic will be based on 10-12 pieces of 
classical music. I am interested in the combination of music and art; I 
completed a degree in piano performance at UMass Amherst before I came 
to FSU to study art and graphic design, so I am excited about the 
opportunity to incorporate my past studies in music into my current 
studies in art.

Writing & research component: I will research and write about the 
history of each piece and composer, and I will analyze the form of each 
piece from a music theory perspective.

Studio art component: I will explore ways to visually portray the 
musical elements (form, structure, style, dynamics, etc.) of each piece. 
I will create 10-12 paintings and drawings (one for each piece of 
music).

Graphic design component: I will combine my text and images into a book.

Timeline: I will work on 1-2 pieces per week (each week, I will research 
and write about one piece of music, create one piece of art, and make 
one book page spread).

If this description okay, I'll submit it.

Thanks,
Cindy
