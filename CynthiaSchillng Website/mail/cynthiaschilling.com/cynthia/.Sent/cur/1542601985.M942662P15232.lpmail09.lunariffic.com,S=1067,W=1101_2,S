Hi Don,

Here is my description of my IDIS project:

My IDIS capstone project will combine my two areas of study: graphic 
design and studio art. My project will be based on 10-12 pieces of 
classical music.

Writing & research component: I will research and write about the 
history of each piece and composer, and I will analyze each piece from a 
music theory perspective.

Studio art component: I will create 10-12 paintings and drawings to 
represent each piece of music.

Graphic design component: I will combine my text and images into a book.

Please let me know if I should change anything or add more details, or 
if it's okay to send to Petri.

Thanks!

Cindy
