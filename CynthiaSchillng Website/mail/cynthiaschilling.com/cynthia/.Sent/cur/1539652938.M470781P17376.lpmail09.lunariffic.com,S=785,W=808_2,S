Hello Professor Rettig,

My professor Don Tarallo gave me your email address and suggested that I 
contact you. I am a senior graphic design student at Fitchburg State 
University. I am planning to apply to the DMI program at MassArt, and I 
am wondering if I could schedule a time to visit and learn more about 
the program.

Thank you, and I hope to hear from you.

Sincerely,
Cynthia Schilling
