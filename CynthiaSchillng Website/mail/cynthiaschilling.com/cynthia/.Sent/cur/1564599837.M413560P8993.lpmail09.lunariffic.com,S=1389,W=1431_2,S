Hi Sara,
Here's the supply list email I sent to the last coordinator. We won't 
need as much paint because there was extra last time (and if we can use 
the leftover paint, we will need to get even less new paint). If there's 
enough money in the budget, I'd suggest more paintbrushes of different 
sizes (I can send a link to brushes if there's enough money for them).

-Packages of canvases:

-Acrylic paint:

-8 oz alizarin crimson
-16 oz primary yellow
-8 oz hooker's green
-4 oz ivory black
-8 oz phtalo blue
-8 oz quinacridone magenta
-16 oz ultramarine blue
-16 oz titanium white
-16 oz titanium white (two whites)

I never know how much paint people will use, so I included more than I 
thought we'll need.

-paper/plastic plates for paint
-paper/plastic cups for cleaning brushes in-between colors
-napkins for cleaning brushes and spills
