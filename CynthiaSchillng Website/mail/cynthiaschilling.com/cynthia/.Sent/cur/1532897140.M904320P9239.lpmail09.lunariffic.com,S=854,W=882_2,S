Hi Don,

Here are the grid webpages I thought were most helpful. I looked through 
my bookmarks and saw I still had them saved.

https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/CSS/CSS_Grid_Layout/Basic_Concepts_of_Grid_Layout

https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/CSS/CSS_Grid_Layout

https://css-tricks.com/auto-sizing-columns-css-grid-auto-fill-vs-auto-fit/

https://gridbyexample.com/examples/

Rocky and I want to plan another hike soon!!!
