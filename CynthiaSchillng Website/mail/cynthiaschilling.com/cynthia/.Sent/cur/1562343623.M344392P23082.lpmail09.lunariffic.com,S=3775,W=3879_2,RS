Great! I'm almost certain the 19th will work, but I won't be able to 
check my schedule until tomorrow night (apologizes for the delayed 
responses; I was out of town this past week). I'll confirm the 19th 
tomorrow night. Is there a specific subject or image people would like 
to paint? If not, I can pick one. I'll send a list of paint colors 
that'd be needed for the painting.

I suggest these:

-Canvas packs (I think either 9"x12" or 11"x14" would be ideal): 
https://www.dickblick.com/products/blick-super-value-canvas-packs/

-Paint (I can send specific colors according to the image we'll paint): 
https://www.dickblick.com/products/blick-studio-acrylics/

-Brushes (optional) - if there's enough money in the budget, I'd suggest 
some additional brushes of different sizes (if not, we can get by with 
the ones that are already at MIT, and I can also bring mine for people 
to borrow).

Other supplies:
-paper/plastic plates for paint
-paper/plastic cups for cleaning brushes in-between colors
-napkins for cleaning brushes and spills


Best,
Cindy
