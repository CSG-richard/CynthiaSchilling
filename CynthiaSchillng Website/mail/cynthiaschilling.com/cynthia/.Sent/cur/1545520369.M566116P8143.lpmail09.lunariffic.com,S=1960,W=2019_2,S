Thanks, it's a dress next to the violin. I put a page on my website with 
some of the photos I took today (they're unedited) 
http://www.cynthiaschilling.com/photos.html I was having a hard time 
with lighting. I took some this morning in sunlight, and then in the 
evening with lightbulbs, but both seem dark. I tried to adjust the 
levels in Photoshop or over-expose it, but then white on the paper 
blends in with the white background. I'll try taking more in the 
daylight tomorrow, so if you have any suggestions on lighting or angles, 
I'd appreciate it! Thanks!
