Hi Don,

That is a wonderful letter! Many, many thanks for taking the time to 
write it! I can't thank you enough for all your help and inspiration, as 
always!

I also took Image and Design with you.

Great, I will add Tarallo Design to my CV. Yes, let me know if there's 
anything I can help with. Always happy to help.

Thank you!
Cindy
