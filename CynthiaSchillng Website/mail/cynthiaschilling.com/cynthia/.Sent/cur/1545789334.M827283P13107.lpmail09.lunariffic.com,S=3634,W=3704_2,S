Hi Don,
Hope you had a nice Christmas! I finished a draft of my grad school 
letter and pasted it here for you in case you want to see it for your 
recommendation letter. I'm also working on my artist statement. The 
thesis-writing exercises you sent me a couple weeks ago are helpful. 
Thank you again for everything!

Dear members of the graduate admissions committee,

I am excited about the prospect of pursuing an MFA in graphic design at 
Boston University. I am passionate about art and design. After earning a 
degree in piano performance with greatest distinction from UMass Amherst 
Commonwealth Honors College, I began pursuing a second degree as an 
interdisciplinary major in graphic design and studio art at Fitchburg 
State University. I have been exploring ways that art and music can 
interact — how tone, dynamics, harmony, and emotion in music can be 
depicted through form, lines, and color. For my senior capstone project, 
I am researching a dozen piano compositions, writing about their 
history, and analyzing their music theory. For each composition, I am 
creating an abstract painting that is related in form, structure and 
expression. In a book, I will combine the text and images, focusing on 
page layouts and micro typography within the text.

I love the process of learning a new skill, working to master it, and 
being able to use it to create something new. In my piano and violin 
playing, I especially enjoy the experimental part of it — trying out 
different touches on the piano keys, varying violin bow speed and 
vibrato, and playing with timing — to create different tones and 
expressions. Similarly, in my art and design work, I enjoy experimenting 
with color, type size, medium, drawing style, layout, etc. to create 
original and innovative pieces.

I have found that my skills in music transfer to graphic design. Both 
art forms require creativity, sensitivity to detail, and emotional 
expression.  The same kind of discipline, incorporation of feedback, and 
continuous reworking that is part of the process of learning and 
performing music is also part of the design process. The quality of mind 
I developed from creative and in-depth thinking about music applies to 
the conceptual aspects of art and design.

I have enjoyed opportunities to apply my design skills. As Website 
Development Assistant at Fitchburg State, I provide technical support to 
faculty and staff and redesign pages to make them more user-friendly and 
visually appealing. I have designed posters, programs, and promotional 
materials for the Fitchburg State orchestra and choirs, Community Music 
Lesson Program, and Women in the Arts events. In addition, I like 
helping others improve their skills. At Fitchburg State, I have worked 
as a piano instructor in the Community Music Lesson Program, and as a 
tutor for writing, music, and web design courses.

In continuing to develop my art and design skills to reach higher levels 
of artistry, I would love the opportunity to take classes and interact 
with other motivated and talented graduate students. I would be thrilled 
to continue my studies in graphic design at Boston University.

Thank you for your consideration.

Sincerely,
Cynthia Schilling
