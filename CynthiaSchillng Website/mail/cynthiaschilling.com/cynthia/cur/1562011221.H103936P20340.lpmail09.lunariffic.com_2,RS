Subject: Instructor for MIT paint & pour event

Hi Cynthia,

I'm Sara Sheffels, a grad student on the Events committee at Ashdown House
(and Haley's former roommate!). We're hosting another "Paint & Pour" event
this summer and we are wondering if you'd be interested in being our
painting instructor again for this event.

Our potential dates are July 19 or 21 in the evening. July 14 would be
another option if the other dates don't work for you, but the event
planning would be slightly rushed, so we'd prefer the later dates. I
believe last time we offered a $50 gift card as compensation; we are no
longer able to purchase gift cards with MIT funds, but I think it should be
possible to just send you a check this time.

Please let me know if you are interested, and if so, if you have a
preference for the date and time!

Best,
Sara
