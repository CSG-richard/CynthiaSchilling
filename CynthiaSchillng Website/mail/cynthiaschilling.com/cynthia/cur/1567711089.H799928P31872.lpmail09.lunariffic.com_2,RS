Hi Cindy, 

How goes it all? 

Sorry to bother you as you start the semester, but I am at school
working on my review dossier (goes to the chair and dean). It would
really be a huge help if I can include your book. I need to hand it in
before the end of this month. Is there any way you could just print one,
even if it is not perfect? I worry that if we wait too long you will be
flooded with grad school duties. 

I am happy to pay for it and if you need me to come and pick it up I
can. It is the only thing not documented of all my thesis and upper
level directed study books--and it is the best one. 

Best,
Don
