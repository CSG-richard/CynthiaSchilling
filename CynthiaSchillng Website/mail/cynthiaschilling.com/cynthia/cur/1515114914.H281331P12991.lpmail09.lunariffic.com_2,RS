Thanks. This is full of great ideas. Nice dress. 

And thank you for your support. I will be producing more in the coming
months and will let you know. 

Been shoveling all day. I hope for some great skiing soon. Saturday my
professor from RISD is coming over for dinner with his family. Alex is
planning the meal. 

Glad the readings are enjoyable for you.
