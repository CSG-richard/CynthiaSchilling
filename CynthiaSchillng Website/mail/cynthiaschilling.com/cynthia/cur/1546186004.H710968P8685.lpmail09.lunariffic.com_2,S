Hi Cindy,

Thanks for sharing. This is looking good. I can feel all the work you put in=
to this. Some thoughts on what to add below. I am really blown away by this n=
ew painting series.=20

-Great falls
Absolutely beautiful! Here is a sign of true poetic talent. I am without wor=
ds. Do you have any more secret works like this hidden? I will send you a ph=
oto of a painting I made with some details of layering. I was obsessed with T=
itian and how he got rich colors through layer. Did you ever consider a degr=
ee in painting? Of course you are a talented designer and will do well there=
 too.=20

-Bach is strong but is too predictable. It needs visual interruption. Perhap=
s scaled shift or swiping slowly to a varied color palette or shapes?
-you could take close ups of the wine infographics and add that. Some close a=
nd then the full scene?
-Dragonflies
-Bowls
-How about a another photo or two to round it out?

-I think the coffee app images are too dark on your site.=20

I am in my studio and can check in later or talk on the phone if that is eas=
ier.

You can pull a lot out of what you already have.=20

Don
