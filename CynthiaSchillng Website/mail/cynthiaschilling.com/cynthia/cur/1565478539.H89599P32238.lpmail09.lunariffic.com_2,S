hi cindy 

how are you? keeping cool? i am enjoying the time away from school and
recovering from a lot of travel. 

sorry to bother you now. you must be busy. i wonder if you could send
along your best images of your paintings with links to the audio. just a
few will do.  i am working on a job application and want to include your
thesis. would you mind? i was planning to send it off before the end of
the month.
