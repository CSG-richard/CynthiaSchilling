Hi Cynthia,=0A=
=0A=
I hope you are well! I was wondering whether you got my previous email. If =
not, I've copied it below.=0A=
Would you be able to send us a list of supplies soon? We will make other ar=
rangements in the meantime.=0A=
=0A=
Many thanks!=0A=
Mukund=0A=

Fantastic! Glad we found a date that works.=0A=
=0A=
We were thinking of having 30 guests, with a budget of $4 per person for su=
pplies. We already have 30 medium size brushes, which worked well on an 8x1=
0 inch canvas. If those brushes work for you, we would then just have to bu=
y paint and 8x10 inch canvases. =0A=
=0A=
Let me know what you think!=0A=

Thanks,=0A=
