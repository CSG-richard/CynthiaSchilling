Hi Katherine, Hi Max, Hi Cindy,=0A=
=0A=
Yay!!! It looks like so far we have a pianist (Max), violinist (Katherine),=
 cellist (me), and a violinist/violist/pianist (Cindy).=0A=
=0A=
Maybe we should find a time for a first rehearsal? Would Wednesday evenings=
 work for everyone? =0A=
=0A=
And we should also think about what music it would be fun to play! :) =0A=
