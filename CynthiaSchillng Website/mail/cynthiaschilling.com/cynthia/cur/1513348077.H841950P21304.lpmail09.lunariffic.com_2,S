Hi Cynthia, 

I hope your concert went well yesterdat. Yesterday was very hectic for
me. Today I am getting caught up in my studio. 

Here is the address for Windblown. It is very easy to find and probably
under 30 minutes from your house. You will see a wooden sign with green
and yellow on the left as you will be driving up from the south: 

http://windblownxc.com/general-info/contact-us.html [2] 

-----WINDBLOWN, 1180 TURNPIKE ROAD, NEW IPSWICH, NH 03071 

Here is their Facebook page. I follow it for updates: 

HTTPS://WWW.FACEBOOK.COM/WINDBLOWN.CROSS.COUNTRY.SKIING/?REF=BR_RS [3] 

They are a cash only business. This Saturday the main lodge is not open
(that is rare) so only a small lodge will be open with soup. This also
means the outhouses are the only option for bathrooms. But they said on
their FB page that the womens' one will have a space heater. 

For food, they typically offer vegetarian soups, coffee, tea, and cocoa
when the main lodge is not open. I will also pack some food and a lunch.
My plan is to be there by 9 or 9:30 and ski until 3:30 or 4. Text me
whenever you arrive. 

The temps should be in the high 20s. 

There are beginner trials, intermediate trails open and groomed. I have
all kinds of wax and stuff to tune up your skis if you need it. 

Don
