Hi Cindy,

This looks great. I would be draw to the openness of it. You could probably a=
lso take their graphic design classes too.=20

I think you would be a good fit. Why not try? Mass Art is ranked higher than=
 many of the other schools. RISD was #1 nationally. Now it is #4. I would al=
ways choose a pure art school if I could.=20

Still awake?

Don
