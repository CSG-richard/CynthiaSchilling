Glad you got the scans. I am very impressed with your compositions and
excited to see what comes of them. Your email below means a lot to me.
Thanks for sharing that thought. You will go far. Treat it like a
practice, the more you do it the better you get. Just like an
instrument. At some point it will be very intuitive and I know you will
get there. 

As much as you learn from me, I learn from you. 

Have a nice weekend.
