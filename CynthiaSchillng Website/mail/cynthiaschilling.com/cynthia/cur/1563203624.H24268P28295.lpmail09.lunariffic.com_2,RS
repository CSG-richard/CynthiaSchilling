Hi Cindy,

I just wanted to check in with you again about the Paint & Pour -- are you
available on August 2, 4, 9, 11, 16, 18 (all Fridays and Sundays) or August
22 (Thursday)? I realize some of these dates are pretty far out, but
unfortunately we need to plan this event at least 2-3 weeks ahead so we
have time to book the room and get approval from Sidney Pacific dorm.

Best,
Sara
