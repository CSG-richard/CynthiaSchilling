Looks good Cindy. You can pull a lot out of this excellent work.=20

Ordering cannot hurt.=20
I would start strong and end strong. In between go for contrasts and make gr=
oups of like things.=20

The Bach piece is five as it is. I always see room for improvement in things=
. It can be stronger.=20
