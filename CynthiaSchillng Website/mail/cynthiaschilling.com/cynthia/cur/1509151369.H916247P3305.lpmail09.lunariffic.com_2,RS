hi cindy, 

oh, thanks. i hope you enjoy it. that is nice of you. i must buy you a
coffee now :) 

just make sure a copy of it does not get out there or students will
steal it. i just got notice that Sherwin Williams, the big paint company
bought it. perhaps we see it on paint cans someday. some company in
finland too. 

have a nice weekend. hiking? not me. but perhaps next weekend. 

i am really enjoying teaching this semester. we have a good group with
lots of imagination. 

this is the best time of year. 

don
