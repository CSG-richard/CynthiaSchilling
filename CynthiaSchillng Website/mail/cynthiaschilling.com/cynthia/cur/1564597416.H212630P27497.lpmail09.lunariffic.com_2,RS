Hi Cindy,

Thanks for letting me know! We are trying to get the event approved for
August 4, 7-9pm, but since that is coming up soon, the alternative is
August 11 (which would probably be 6-8pm).

I think something summery would be nice since this is the summer Paint &
Pour event (maybe a beach scene or landscape of some kind?). I personally
think the typical images offered at "Paint Night" events look a little
contrived, so feel free to do something a bit more creative or abstract. If
you have ideas, feel free to go with what you think will work; otherwise, I
will consult the other organizers to come up with a more specific idea.

Best,
Sara

&gt;&gt;&gt; Great! I&#39;m almost certain the 19th will work, but I won&#3=

&gt;&gt;&gt; I suggest these:<br>

&gt;&gt;&gt; -Canvas packs (I think either 9&quot;x12&quot; or 11&quot;x14&=

&gt;&gt;&gt; <br>
&gt;&gt;&gt; -Brushes (optional) - if there&#39;s enough money in the budge=

&gt;&gt; suggest some additional brushes of different sizes (if not, we can=

&gt;&gt;&gt; <br>

39;re hosting<br>
&gt;&gt; another<br>
&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; &quot;Paint &amp; Pour&quot; event this summer and we =
are wondering if you&#39;d<br>
&gt;&gt; be<br>
&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; interested in being our painting instructor again for =
this<br>
&gt;&gt; event.<br>
&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; Our potential dates are July 19 or 21 in the eveni=
ng. July 14<br>
&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; would be another option if the other dates don&#39;t w=
ork for you,<br>
&gt;&gt; but<br>
&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; the event planning would be slightly rushed, so we&#39=
;d prefer the<br>
&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; later dates. I believe last time we offered a $50 gift=
 card as<br>
&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; compensation; we are no longer able to purchase gift c=
ards with<br>
&gt;&gt; MIT<br>
&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; funds, but I think it should be possible to just send =
you a<br>
&gt;&gt; check<br>
&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; this time.<br>
&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; Please let me know if you are interested, and if s=
o, if you<br>
&gt;&gt; have a<br>
&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; preference for the date and time!<br>
&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; Best,<br>
&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; Sara<br>
