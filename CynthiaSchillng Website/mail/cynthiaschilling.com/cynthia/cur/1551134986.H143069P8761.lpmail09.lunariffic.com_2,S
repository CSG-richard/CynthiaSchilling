My paintings are visualizations of the expressive and emotional qualities of musical compositions. They translate one sense to another: sound to sight. Kandinsky wrote "With few exceptions music has been for some centuries the art which has devoted itself not to the preproduction of natural phenomena, but rather to the expression of the artist's soul, in musical sound." (p. 19 in Concerning the Spiritual in Art). While painting, I had to find a balance between deliberate and spontaneous -- so not making marks so deliberate that the painting looks too calculated, but not so spontaneous that it looks like a mess of random paint splotches. I picked some of my favorite pieces of music. I've played most of the pieces I picked and spent hundreds of hours practicing them, so I knew them well and had already put extensive thought into the characters of each
piece.
> 
> At first, it was very overwhelming to decide how to paint the music. The emotions that music and art evoke are subjective. Additionally, different musicians interpret and play pieces differently, taking liberties in tempo (subtly slowing down or speeding up), dynamics (playing loudly or softly), touch (e.g. a sharp, attack sound vs. round, warm sound), articulations (e.g. legato vs staccato), all of which creates different (sometimes wildly different) characters and moods. So the same piece (or parts of the piece) could sound like one character or mood when played by one musician, and a completely different emotion by another. All of the pieces I chose are complex and have many different moods and characters within each piece, so I chose the dominant emotion(s) of each piece to portray in their corresponding paintings.
> 
> There's an infinite number of ways to portray the music, and I didn't have any rules or limitations, which was overwhelming. The composer Igor Stravinsky stated "Whatever diminishes constraint, diminishes strength. The more constraints one imposes, the more one frees one's self of the chains that shackle the spirit." (p. 65 of Poetics of Music in the Form of Six Lessons, by Stravinsky). I had to create some some rules for each painting, such as a palette of  certain colors or painting no sharp angles. My approach to each painting was to listen to the piece and form a vague mental image of possible colors, form, composition for the painting, based on the piece's characters, elements, and overall structure. I then started painting using that mental image as a guide, but usually changing my plan along the way. Sometimes I'd accidentally make a mark on the canvas, but then use the mistake to go in a new direction. Sometimes I'd stop in the middle and realize the painting was looking
like another piece of music, so I'd switch the piece and continue. Other times, I didn't like how it was turning out and everything I'd do would keep making it worse, so I'd paint over the whole thing with a solid color and start over.
> 
> Color is an important part of expression my paintings. Kandinsky wrote"...the sound of colours is so definite that it would be hard to find anyone who would try to express bright yellow in the bass notes, or dark lake in the treble." (P.25 of Concerning the Spiritual in Art). I generally used saturated or bright colors, and rarely any shades of gray. Kandinsky writes "...in gray, there is no possibility of movement, because gray consists of two colours that have no active force..." (p.37 of Concerning the Spiritual in Art). In terms of form, most of the marks in my painting are curved or irregular shapes, which to me is all much more expressive and beautiful than straight lines, perfect geometric shapes, and sharp angles that computers can make.
> 
> The sense of emotions in pieces and art go two ways: when I am learning piano pieces, sometimes I instinctively sense a certain character for a particular passage and play accordingly; other times, I don't have a clear idea of its character, and have to come up with one to apply. A musician can play a piece with amazing technical abilities, but without some kind of expression or feeling, the playing sounds boring, like computer playing the piece. In my paintings, I wanted to portray the same organic, expressive qualities that are present in human musicians' playing. I embraced any kind of "imperfections." In music, even the greatest musicians make mistakes and play a few wrong notes out of the thousands and thousands of notes they play in a concert. Some people frown upon mistakes -- and severe mistakes are not ideal -- but I actually think a few minor mistakes can enhance the performance. For example, in a piano passage of large chords that jump from one side of the piano to the
other at a fast tempo, the pianist might accidentally hit two notes with the thumb at once. That'd be a minor mistake, but in a way, it would convey the extreme technical demands and amplify the excitement. So in my paintings, I welcomed many of the unintentional marks I made and didn't paint over them with what I originally intended.

> Schumann wrote at the beginning of the piece "So rasch wie mÃ¶glich," which means "play as quickly as possible," and then later on "Schneller," and "Noch Schneller," which means "play faster than that." Of course, that's impossible, but it indicates that Schumann intends for it to be played with intense frenetic energy. The syncopations and constantly-changing moods amplify this energy.
