hi cindy, 

hope you are enjoying this wonderful day. 

i will follow up with a call later. 

today i was having a coffee at a local cafe and found out they have
exhibitions for young artists. i talked with them and they have an
opening in may and august. would you like to do the may one? you need to
only make labels and write a paragraph artist statement (which could be
added to the book). i think it would be so nice to share this with the
world and a good component to add to your cv. just email her and let her
know that i talked to her to jog her memory (cannot recall her name, it
may be in the image i sent). 

we could all get together for a lunch there once it is set up. i can
help you hang it. 

writing:
i think you should tap into making more connections to artists that have
worked with concerns similar to yours. read more about orphism. write
about how your work is within a context of past movements. perhaps you
can quote some specific aspects of orphism that connect to your work.
was kandisnky considered an orphist? who inspired you as a book
designer? irma boom? look around. 

make one more painting if you have time--after writing your statement
and revising your paper. this back and forth is how you grow--you will
get a lot this in grad school along with having to connect your work to
a larger context of movements and theories of past and preset. 

the book. can you email me that along with the new writing this week?
work also on the book cover. think about using sketches and process on
the cover; that could be interesting--leaving the inside for the
polished work. 

until soon. 

don
