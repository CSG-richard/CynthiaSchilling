Hi Katherine, Hi Max, Hi Cindy,

Yay!!! It looks like so far we have a pianist (Max), violinist (Katherine),=
 cellist (me), and a violinist/violist/pianist (Cindy).

Maybe we should find a time for a first rehearsal? Would Wednesday evenings=
 work for everyone?=20

And we should also think about what music it would be fun to play! :)=20

Best,

Haley=20

Hi Haley,

I'm interested! I might be more free in late July-August, but can probably =
join in June.

I play the violin.

Best,
Katherine
