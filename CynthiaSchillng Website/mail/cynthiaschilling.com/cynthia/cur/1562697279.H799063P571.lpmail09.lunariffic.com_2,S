Hi Haley,

Yes, I had already contacted Cindy since she has led previous events, but
since our initial July dates didn't work for her I wanted to reach out to
see if any residents were interested. We are probably going to have to move
the event into August though anyway, so hopefully we can find a day when
Cindy is available!

Best,
Sara
