hi cindy 

portfolio of design work;
-if i had to leave something out it would be the global warming

-the thumbnail of the cleveland project still shows the phone number on
the envelope

-I think I would make larger jpegs for the multiple images when that
reveals more about the project or lets it see reveal more detail.

The art to show-in my opinion
-shoes
-bowls
-glasses 

i rested. worked on a job application. wished i was hiking. 

happy to help. always. always.

I'm starting to fill out the applications - it lets you upload 15-20 files - should I upload a JPEG file of each project or a photograph of the printed projects? I'm not sure I can upload multiple images of each project (unless I combine multiple photos into a pdf or large image - should I do that?). Also should I include any of my drawings or paintings? I have 19 graphic design pieces on my website to choose from and 13 paintings/drawings, but I just need to submit the best 15-20 in total. If you have any suggestions on which ones to submit, I'd really appreciate it! Thank you for your advice (I know I've asked you so many questions - you've been a huge help!). Hope you enjoyed the nice day! :)
