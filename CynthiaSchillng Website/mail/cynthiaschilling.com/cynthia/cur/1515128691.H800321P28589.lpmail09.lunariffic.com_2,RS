I forgot to tell you that I got a coffee can aside for you. Anyhow if you st=
art sooner you need to put many holes in the bottom of the tuna can then put=
 it open side down in the coffee can. The holes will face the top of the cof=
fee can. You fill it up with solution to cover the can by about 1/2 inch. Th=
en just put  the brush in and run it over the holes in the tuna can. All the=
 paint will fall through the holes to the bottom of the coffee can and the c=
leaning area will always remain paint free.=20

If you bring a tuna can to out next skiing outing o can do it for you in 5 m=
ins. Just clean it out :)
