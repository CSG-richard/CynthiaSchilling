Yes, sounds good. 

When will you start the book, obtain a proof, and complete the final
design? Make a weekly plan on when we will review the spreads so we can
also be sure to consider the micro typgraphy within the book as I know
that was an interest of yours. 

I suggest to have a prototype of the book made prior to completing all
the paintings. Perhaps by early to mid March.
