Hi Cynthia,

Sounds great! We should definitely talk next Wed =E2=80=94 are you bringing a=
 violin or viola or will you be playing piano?=20

As for piano chamber music, some of my favorites are the Tchaikovsky Piano T=
rio, Brahms Piano Trio No. 1, Archduke and Ghost Trios, and Brahms Piano Qua=
rtets. I=E2=80=99m not very familiar with newer music but am down to read an=
ything!

Best,
Katherine=20
