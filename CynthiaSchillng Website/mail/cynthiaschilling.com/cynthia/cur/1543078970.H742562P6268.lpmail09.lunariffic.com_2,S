hi cindy 

thanks and i hope you had a nice one too. i did. been skiing a little
too. 

this is a good start. however, i think you have a better direction on
the right side than the left. the success in the right side is when the
comparison is between to unlike things that have a similar form. it
makes a kind of visual rhyme between two unlike things and delights the
mind to see seemingly unlike things as like; a visual analogy. try to
revisit the left side making it more simple with things more obviously
unlike. 

not sure black is the best background. try to make a file where you can
have a layer for each background and export them so we can compare. try
grey (50% black, white, and black). could also try a combination of
them.
