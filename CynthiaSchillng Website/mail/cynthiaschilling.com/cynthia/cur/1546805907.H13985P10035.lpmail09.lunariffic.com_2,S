Hi Cindy, 

Well done! 

I would just offer a few small edits: 

-Use an en dash in place of hyphens 2008-present --change to
2008-present. Press option then the hypen key. Hyphens are used within
words like part-time. En dash is used in place of the word to. A little
longer. 

-Women in the Art, I may italicize it _Women in the Arts_ 

-CV section titles may be better bolded like your name. 

I think the letter is really great. Good luck--in boca al lupo! 

Don
