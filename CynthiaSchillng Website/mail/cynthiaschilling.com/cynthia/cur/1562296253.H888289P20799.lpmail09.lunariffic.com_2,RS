Hi Cindy,

Great! We are planning for 20-25 participants. The organizers of the
previous event said we still have the brushes they purchased. It would be
very helpful if you could send me a list of other supplies we will need!

We will go ahead and plan for July 19th, but please let me know ASAP if you
discover that you have a conflict for that night.

I will let you know when the event time and specific location are finalized
(it will be a room in the Sidney Pacific dorm building). Looking forward to
it!

Thanks,
Sara
