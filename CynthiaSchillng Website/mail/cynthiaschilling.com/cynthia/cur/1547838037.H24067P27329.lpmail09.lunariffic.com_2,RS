Hi Cindy, 

If you would like, I need to try to make a better cover art for Poeta
Color. 

I will sell it as clip art for those who do not want it as a font. I
want to start one Creative Market. I was thinking if you could look
around on the flower category and see what kind of aesthetic there is.
Try to fit in, but stand out, if you know what I mean. I think perhaps
some painterly approach (with the background or something) will warm up
my rather sterile presentations. 

https://creativemarket.com/graphics/objects

https://creativemarket.com/search?q=flower&categoryIDs=1&page=1

size: 1820 x 1214 (vector art in Illustrator). You can use your copy of
Poeta color. 

I hope you feel this would be a worthy portfolio piece for you. I can
pay $25 for the image. 

I may resize it for another venue later. 

Thanks. 

Don
