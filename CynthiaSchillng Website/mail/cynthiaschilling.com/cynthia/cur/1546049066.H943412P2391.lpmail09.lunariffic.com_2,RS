I remember the discussion in the critique and seeing multiple readings in th=
e poster. It is strong. Happy to help you. You must have a lot to prepare. I=
t is hard the first time to make sense of all this. It becomes simpler.=20

Not sure if this is a coincidence, but a person from Mass Art just bought my=
 font. I submitted my application today there.=20

I need to hike. Getting computer numb. Will you?=20

I will start painting again.=20
