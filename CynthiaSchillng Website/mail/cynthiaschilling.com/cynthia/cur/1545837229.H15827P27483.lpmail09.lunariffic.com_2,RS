Hi Cindy, 

I had a nice time. How was your glogg? Get a little tipsy? Fun to design
after a little of that. 

Today I will rest and exercise. Need some outdoor time. 

I hope you do not mind, I felt I should offer some feedback. Try to read
it aloud and hear the redundancies. Do not leave any of the food
uncooked for the reader. 

See attached. Your letter coming soon. 

Don

After earning a degree in piano performance with greatest distinction from UMass Amherst Commonwealth Honors College, I began pursuing a second degree as an interdisciplinary major in graphic design and studio art at Fitchburg State University. I have been exploring ways that art and music can interact -- how tone, dynamics, harmony, and emotion in music can be depicted through form, lines, and color. For my senior capstone project, I am researching a dozen piano compositions, writing about their history, and analyzing their music theory. For each composition, I am creating an abstract painting that is related in form, structure and expression. In a book, I will combine the text and images, focusing on page layouts and micro typography within the text.

In my piano and violin playing, I especially enjoy the experimental part of it -- trying out different touches on the piano keys, varying violin bow speed and vibrato, and playing with timing -- to create different tones and expressions. Similarly, in my art and design work, I enjoy experimenting with color, type size, medium, drawing style, layout, etc. to create original and innovative pieces.

The same kind of discipline, incorporation of feedback, and continuous reworking that is part of the process of learning and performing music is also part of the design process. The quality of mind I developed from creative and in-depth thinking about music applies to the conceptual aspects of art and design.

As Website Development Assistant at Fitchburg State, I provide technical support to faculty and staff and redesign pages to make them more user-friendly and visually appealing.

In addition, I like helping others improve their skills. At Fitchburg State, I have worked as a piano instructor in the Community Music Lesson Program, and as a tutor for writing, music, and web design courses.
