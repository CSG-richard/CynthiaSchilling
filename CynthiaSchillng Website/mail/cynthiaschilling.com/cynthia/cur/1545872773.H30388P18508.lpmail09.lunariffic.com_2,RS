this email is better. 

i was thinking, since you already have it all ready, why not try RISD if
you are willing? i should not let my experience there color what it
could be like for you too much. i was part of a transition between two
philosophies (old and new)--and the older professors were so close to
me. anyhow, i am crazy enough to apply there for a job again. then when
schools ask what other schools you apply to it looks good. if you did
get in and decide to go, i could connect you with some great people. but
yes, there are some not so great ones too. the grad students are a mixed
bag. 

just a thought. 

anyhow, more thoughts. am i overwhelming you yet?------ 

i think it would help to show you are cognizant of the kind of education
in design you have, which is general and broad (as most BS and BA
programs are). in showing this awareness you show you understand the
context you are emerging from. you can then follow up with a statement
that this broad experience in design has generated a lot of
passion--within which you now desire to go deeper into more focused
areas. this is what grad school opens up--in addition to finding your
own voice of design. saying something along these lines will remedy you
not stating much about what you are specifically interested to do. 

_I find that I was fortunate to have a broad and general graphic design
education at Fitchburg. This has afforded me to sample many diverse
dimensions of the discipline. I look forward to the graduate experience
where I can be given the chance to find a more focused direction and my
voice as a designer._ 

yadda yadda yadda.... 

you can tell me to stop anytime.
